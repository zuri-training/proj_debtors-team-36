# proj_debtors-team-36

## Background
This is a platform that allows schools in a certain locality to list the directory of people owing them so as to avoid debtors applying to other schools with pending debts. The website will also enable schools to keep the debt summary (amount that has been paid and collected) and track debts of various students and also give the debtors access to challenge information put up by the schools. -Team 36

## About the Project

* My_debtors is a website that allows schools in a certain locality to list the directory of people owing them so as to avoid debtors applying to other schools with pending debts. 
* This project was created to solve/avoid the problem of students applying to another school in the locality while still having pending or uncleared debts from their previous school.
* This project is solely aimed at schools to help keep the aformentioned problem in check and also allows the students that have posted as debtors to challenge and contend the post.

2. Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button on the upper right corner of the Repo page.*
3. Make a local clone: 
     Click on the "Code" button on the Repo page
     Copy the URL for the forked Repo "https://github.com/github_username/proj_debtors-team-36.git"
     Create a Folder on your Local machine / Computer for the project Workspace
     Open Command prompt / Terminal in the same folder location
     In your Terminal, type: <br/>
        `git clone https://github.com/github_username/proj_debtors-team-36.git`
4. Open terminal and set upstream branch: <br/>
    `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zuri-training/proj_debtors-team-36`
5. Pull upstream to get up to date with the original repo:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
6. Create a new branch for the task you are working on :<br/>
    `git checkout -b branchName`<br/>
    *(Make sure your branchName is descriptive in context to the feature you are working on. Also be sure to check which branch you are on using `git status` before you begin working)*
7. When you're done with your task, do:<br/>
    `git add`<br/>
   - Commit your work with a message:<br/>
   `git commit -m "message"`
8. To avoid conflicts:<br/>
    `git pull upstream main`
9. Then push your branch:<br/>
    `git push origin branchName` - This creates the branch remotely and pushes to that branch on the Github
10. Go to Github and create a new pull request to the main branch. It will then be reviewed and merged into the master.
